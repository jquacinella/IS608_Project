      "# IS608 Project -- James Quacinella\n",

      "## Goal\n",
      "\n",
      "The goal of this project is to create cloropleth map of energy consumption on a per-county level. Data from the EIA gives data on utility level demand and what counties utilities deliver power to. We use data, plus Census data on population, to come up with an estimate of per-county energy consumption. This methodology will be explained below.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Data Sources\n",
      "\n",
      "* [EIA Form 618](http://www.eia.gov/electricity/data/eia861/index.html) - This data folder has many Excel files, two of which are valuable\n",
      "  * Service Territories maps each County to all the utility IDs that serves it\n",
      "  * Retail data maps the amount of energy produced by each utlitity\n",
      "* Annual Estimates of the Resident Population: April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2013 from U.S. Census Bureau, Population Division\n",
      "  * Actually downloaded from [FactFinder](http://factfinder2.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?src=bkmk)\n",
      "\n",
      "## High Level Code Overview\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is some pseudo-code decribing the whole process, from raw data to final map output\n",
      "\n",
      "* Build a mapping from county ID to its 2012 population (2012 being latest data from the EIA)\n",
      "* Build a mapping from utility ID to the total energy output of that utility\n",
      "* Build a mapping from utility ID to list of county IDs is serves\n",
      "* Derive a mapping from utility ID to the sum of county populations of all the counties it serves\n",
      "* For each county\n",
      "  * For each utility that serves this county, calculate an estimate of the county's consumption based of the ratio of the county's population to the total population the utility serves.\n",
      "* Output the final county ID to consumption estimate to CSV. This will be served via a webserver to D3\n",
      "\n",
      "## Issues\n",
      "\n",
      "* The EIA data maps the Utility to a County by name, which did not eactly match the names of counties in the census data. This required some manual cleanup, which are being handled by the initial load data function.\n",
      "* The EIA data does not have more granular data about how much each county consumes of its total energy output. A methodlolgy needed to be developed to approximate this data. I have contacted the EIA for comment, with no response yet.\n",
      "* Not all utilities have retail data. When calculating how much energy was consumed by a county, if we come across a utility we do not have data on, we assume 0. It might be better to take an average of all other utilities as a better approximation of any missing utility data.\n",
